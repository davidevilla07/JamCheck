# JamCheck

We are a team of first year students at the Vocational Training and Development Institute, Gordon Town, Jamaica persuing a first degree in Information & Communication Technology.

In this degree programme we had to complete a course titled "Introduction to Web Technologies" with Mr. Trevoir Williams being our Lecturer.

In this course we were taught to use components of website development such as HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP, GITHUB & NETLIFY.

We were given a final project to complete a website of our choice, so we created JamCheck.com

This website will give Jamaicans who are desirous of purchasing a used car, the necessary information about the car before buying it.
